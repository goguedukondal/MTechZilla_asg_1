This is Pomodro timer App , initially it loads Login page. It asks user to provide email address and password. If user has been signed up earlier ,then,after giving proper credentials user can see timer page else user need to be signed up first. To maitain collected data from user i have used firebase.In this application i have used react-routing inorder to switch from one page to other dynamically.In Timer page i created timer logic so that user can start timer,pause timer and reset timer.The intial value of timer is 25 minutes after clicking on start button the count down will start.By clicking on Pause button timer will stop. In the same way by clicking on reset button timer will reset to 25 menutes again. To build this logic i have used setInterval ,clearInterval functions, useState for maintaining states,useEffect for performing side Effects. In the Timer page user can see log out button on clicking on that button he is logged out.
